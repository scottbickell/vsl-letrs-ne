Dear %%first_name%%,

We are excited to announce our LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) professional development was chosen by the University of Nebraska at Lincoln as an MTSS-selected professional learning solution. LETRS is a flexible, interactive, blended PD that helps educators understand and develop an expertise in the delivery of reading instruction.

- Who is LETRS for? Teachers, coaches, and administrators of early literacy and language skills specific to K–3 and struggling students of all grade levels.
- What is LETRS? Authored by literacy experts Dr. Louisa Moats and Dr. Carol Tolman, LETRS is a professional development solution that strengthens any curriculum and helps educators understand how students learn to read, write, and spell—and why some struggle.
- Why use LETRS? Not only is it a comprehensive course of study that addresses the five key components of reading, but it also offers in-person and blended options.

Learn more about how LETRS can empower your MTSS teachers with the instructional foundation and skills they need to teach reading:
